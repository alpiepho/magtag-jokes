  "Nowadays you don't go around on the street kicking people, punching people \u2014 because if you do (makes gun shape with hand), well that's it \u2014 I don't care how good you are.\nBruce Lee interview on the Pierre Berton Show (1971)",
  "When I look around I always learn something, and that is to be yourself always, express yourself, and have faith in yourself. Do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate him. Now that seems to be the prevalent thing happening in Hong Kong, like they always copy mannerism, but they never start from the root of his being and that is, how can I be me?\nBruce Lee",
  "You know what I want to think of myself? As a human being. Because, I mean I don't want to be like \"As Confucius say,\" but under the sky, under the heavens there is but one family. It just so happens man that people are different.\nBruce Lee: The Lost Interview (1971)",
  "When you're talking about fighting, as it is, with no rules, well then, baby you'd better train every part of your body!\nBruce Lee: The Lost Interview (1971)",
  "All types of knowledge, ultimately mean self knowledge.\nBruce Lee: The Lost Interview (1971)",
  "When I look around, I always learn something: to be always yourself, and to express yourself, to have faith in yourself. Do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.\nRadio interview with Ted Thomas (1972)",
  "Boards don't hit back.\nAs \"Mr. Lee\" in Enter the Dragon (1973); Bruce Lee's character said this to Robert Wall's character \"O'Hara\", after the latter had broken a board in the air with his fist in an act of attempted intimidation.",
  "A good martial artist does not become tense, but ready. Not thinking, yet not dreaming. Ready for whatever may come. When the opponent expands, I contract; and when he contracts, I expand. And when there is an opportunity, \"I\" do not hit, \"it\" hits all by itself.\nBruce Lee: Enter the Dragon (1973); In a conversation with an older member of the temple.",
  "Don't think, feel....it is like a finger pointing a way to the moon. Don't concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory!\nBruce Lee: Enter the Dragon (1973); In a training session with one of the temple students.",
  "Man, the living creature, the creating individual, is always more important than any established style or system.\nAs quoted in \"From Wing Chun to Jeet Kune Do\" by Jesse R. Glover in Black Belt Vol. 31, No. 9 (September 1993),",
  "Use only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it.\nAs quoted in Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit (1994) by Bruce Thomas (1994),",
  "Forget about winning and losing; forget about pride and pain. Let your opponent graze your skin and you smash into his flesh; let him smash into your flesh and you fracture his bones; let him fracture your bones and you take his life. Do not be concerned with escaping safely \u2014 lay your life before him.\nAs quoted in Bruce Lee: Artist of Life (1999) edited by John R. Little,",
  "There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level.\nAs quoted in The Art of Expressing the Human Body (1998) edited by John R. Little,",
  "Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water. Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless \u2014 like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.\nBruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey (2000); here, Lee was reciting lines he wrote for his short lived role on the TV series Longstreet.",
  "For a momentThe surrounding utters no sound.Time ceases.The Paradise of Dreams come true.\n\"For A Moment\", Bruce Lee's hand-written poem, from Bruce Lee Papers \u2014 as quoted in Bruce Lee: Artist of Life (2001) edited by John Little,",
  "Jeet Kune Do favors formlessness so that it can assume all forms and since Jeet Kune Do has no style, it can fit in with all styles. As a result, Jeet Kune Do utilizes all ways and is bound by none and, likewise, uses any techniques which serve its end.",
  "When there is freedom from mechanical conditioning, there is simplicity. The classical man is just a bundle of routine, ideas and tradition. If you follow the classical pattern, you are understanding the routine, the tradition, the shadow \u2014 you are not understanding yourself.",
  "Do not deny the classical approach, simply as a reaction, or you will have created another pattern and trapped yourself there.",
  "Truth has no path. Truth is living and, therefore, changing. Awareness is without choice, without demand, without anxiety; in that state of mind, there is perception. To know oneself is to study oneself in action with another person. Awareness has no frontier; it is giving of your whole being, without exclusion.\nThis statement probably derives from a famous one of Jiddu Krishnamurti: \"Truth is a pathless land.\"",
  "To contemplate a thing implies maintaining oneself OUTSIDE it, resolved to keep a distance between it and ourselves.",
  "Running water never grows stale. So you just have to 'keep on flowing.'",
  "If one loves, one need not have an ideology of love.",
  "The happiness that is derived from excitement is like a brilliant fire \u2014 soon it will go out. Before we married, we never had the chance to go out to nightclubs. We only spent our nights watching TV and chatting. Many young couples live a very exciting life when they are in love. So, when they marry, and their lives are reduced to calmness and dullness, they will feel impatient and will drink the bitter cup of a sad marriage.",
  "Of course you\u2019re there. Death is always there. So why was I afraid? Your leap is swift. Your claws are sharp and merciful. What can you take from me which is not already yours? . . . Everything I have done until now has been fruitless. It has led to nothing. There was no other path except that it led to nothing \u2014 and before me now there is only one real fact \u2014 Death. The truth I have been seeking \u2014 this truth is Death. Yet Death is also a seeker. Forever seeking me. So \u2014 we have met at last. And I am prepared. I am at peace. Because I will conquer death with death.",
  "Neither. I think of myself as a human being.",
  "The Three Stages of Cultivation \u2014 The first is the primitive stage. It is a stage of original ignorance in which a person knows nothing about the art of combat. In a fight, he simply blocks and strikes instinctively without a concern for what is right and wrong. Of course, he may not be so-called scientific, but, nevertheless, being himself, his attacks or defenses are fluid. The second stage \u2014 the stage of sophistication, or mechanical stage \u2014 begins when a person starts his training. He is taught the different ways of blocking, striking, kicking, standing, breathing, and thinking \u2014 unquestionably, he has gained the scientific knowledge of combat, but unfortunately his original self and sense of freedom are lost, and his action no longer flows by itself. His mind tends to freeze at different movements for calculations and analysis, and even worse, he might be called \u201cintellectually bound\u201d and maintain himself outside of the actual reality. The third stage \u2014 the stage of artlessness, or spontaneous stage \u2014 occurs when, after years of serious and hard practice, the student realizes that after all, gung fu is nothing special. And instead of trying to impose on his mind, he adjusts himself to his opponent like water pressing on an earthen wall. It flows through the slightest crack. There is nothing to try to do but try to be purposeless and formless, like water. All of his classical techniques and standard styles are minimized, if not wiped out, and nothingness prevails. He is no longer confined.",
  "Using no way as way; Having no limitation as limitation.",
  "In Jeet Kune Do, it\u2019s not how much you have learned, but how much you have absorbed from what you have learned. It is not how much fixed knowledge you can accumulate, but what you can apply livingly that counts. \u2018Being\u2019 is more valued than \"doing\".",
  "You have to keep your reflexes so that when you want it \u2014 it\u2019s there. When you want to move \u2014 you are moving. And when you move, you are determined to move! Not accepting even one inch less than 100 percent of your honest feelings. Not anything less than that. So that is the type of thing you have to train yourself into. To become one with your feelings so that, when you think \u2014 it is.",
  "In life, what more can you ask for than to be real? To fulfill one\u2019s potential instead of wasting energy on [attempting to] actualize one\u2019s dissipating image, which is not real and an expenditure of one\u2019s vital energy. We have great work ahead of us, and it needs devotion and much, much energy. To grow, to discover, we need involvement, which is something I experience every day \u2014 sometimes good, sometimes frustrating. No matter what, you must let your inner light guide you out of the darkness.",
  "None whatsoever.\nWhen asked what major religion he was affiliated with in 1972 by journalist Alex Ben Block,",
  "To be perfectly frank, I really do not.\nWhen asked if he believed in God,",
  "I believe in sleeping.\nWhen asked by his brother Robert if he believed in God,",
  "There is no such thing as maturity. There is instead an ever-evolving process of maturing. Because when there is a maturity, there is a conclusion and a cessation. That\u2019s the end. That\u2019s when the coffin is closed. You might be deteriorating physically in the long process of aging, but your personal process of daily discovery is ongoing. You continue to learn more and more about yourself every day.",
  "I have come to discover through earnest personal experience and dedicated learning that ultimately the greatest help is self-help; that there is no other help but self-help\u2014 doing one\u2019s best, dedicating one\u2019s self wholeheartedly to a given task, which happens to have no end but is an ongoing process. I have done a lot during these years of my process. A swell in my process, I have changed from self-image actualization to self-actualization, from blindly following propaganda, organized truths, etc. to searching internally for the cause of my ignorance.",
  "Whether or not we can get together, remember well that art \u201clives\u201d where absolute freedom is. With all the training thrown to nowhere, with a mind (if there is such a verbal substance) perfectly unaware of its own working, with the \u201cself\u201d vanishing nowhere, the art of JKD attains its perfection.",
  "You must have complete determination. The worst opponent you can come across is one whose aim has become an obsession. For instance, if a man has decided that he is going to bite off your nose no matter what happens to him in the process, the chances are he will succeed in doing it. He may be severely beaten up, too, but that will not stop him from carrying out his objective. That is the real fighter.",
  "Walk on.",
  "Jeet Kune Do rejects all restrictions imposed by form and formality and emphasizes the clever use of the mind and body to defend and attack.\nPart 2 \"Jeet Kune Do \u2014 The Fundamentals\"",
  "An instructor should exemplify the things he seeks to teach. It will be of great advantage if you yourself can do all you ask of your students and more.\nPart 5 \"On training in Jeet Kune Do\"",
  "As an instructor, you must be able to distinguish between poor performance caused by lack of ability or aptitude on the part of the student and poor performance caused by lack of effort. You should treat the first with patience and the latter with firmness. You must never apply sarcasm and ridicule.\nPart 5 \"On training in Jeet Kune Do\"",
  "Even today, I dare not say that I have reached a state of achievement. I'm still learning, for learning is boundless.\nPart 6 \"Beyond System \u2014 The Ultimate Source of Jeet Kune Do\"",
  "The man who is really serious, with the urge to find out what truth is, has no style at all. He lives only in what is.\nPart 6 \"Beyond System \u2014 The Ultimate Source of Jeet Kune Do\"",
  "Take inventory of everyone with whom you have contact.\nPart 6 \"Beyond System \u2014 The Ultimate Source of Jeet Kune Do\"",

  "The timeless moment. \u2014 The \"moment\" has no yesterday or tomorrow. It is not the result of thought and therefore has no time.",

  "To realize freedom the mind has to learn to look at life, which is a vast movement, without the bondage of time, for freedom lies beyond the field of consciousness \u2014 care for watching, but don't stop and interpret \"I am free,\" then you're living in a memory of something that has gone before.",

  "Be aware of doing your best to understand the ROOT in life, and realize the DIRECT and the INDIRECT are in fact a complementary WHOLE. It is to see things as they are and not to become attached to anything \u2014 to be unconscious meant to be innocent of the working of a relative (empirical) mind \u2014 where there is no abiding of thought anywhere on anything \u2014 this is being unbound. This not abiding anywhere is the root of our life.",
  "Concentration is the ROOT of all the higher abilities in man.",
  "Seek to understand the root. \u2014 It is futile to argue as to which single leaf, which design of branch, or which attractive flower you like; when you understand the root, you understand all its blossoming.",
  "What we are after is the ROOT and not the branches. The root is the real knowledge; the branches are surface knowledge. Real knowledge breeds \"body feel\" and personal expression; surface knowledge breeds mechanical conditioning and imposing limitation and squelches creativity.",
  "Flow in the living moment. \u2014 We are always in a process of becoming and NOTHING is fixed. Have no rigid system in you, and you'll be flexible to change with the ever changing. OPEN yourself and flow, my friend. Flow in the TOTAL OPENNESS OF THE LIVING MOMENT. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. Moving, be like water.

  "The Western approach to reality is mostly through theory, and theory begins by denying reality \u2014 to talk about reality, to go around reality, to catch anything that attracts our sense-intellect and abstract it away from reality itself. Thus philosophy begins by saying that the outside world is not a basic fact, that its existence can be doubted and that every proposition in which the reality of the outside world is affirmed is not an evident proposition but one that needs to be divided, dissected and analyzed. It is to stand consciously aside and try to square a circle.",
  "In Science we have finally come back to the pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus, who said everything is flow, flux, process. There are no \"things.\" NOTHINGNESS in Eastern language is \"no-thingness\". We in the West think of nothingness as a void, an emptiness, an nonexistence. In Eastern philosophy and modern physical science, nothingness \u2014 no-thingness \u2014 is a form of process, ever moving.",

  "If thought exists, I who think and the world about which I think also exist; the one exists but for the other, having no possible separation between them. Therefore, the world and I are both in active correlation; I am that which sees the world, and the world is that which is seen by me. I exist for the world and the world exists for me. \u2026 One sure and primary and fundamental fact is the joint existence of a subject and of its world. The one does not exist without the other. I acquire no understanding of myself except as I take account of objects, of the surroundings. I do not think unless I think of things \u2014 and there I find myself.",
  "When we hold to the core, the opposite sides are the same if they are seen from the center of the moving circle. I do not experience; I am experience. I am not the subject of experience; I am that experience. I am awareness. Nothing else can be I or can exist.",

  "Liberate yourself from concepts and see the truth with your own eyes. \u2014 It exists HERE and NOW; it requires only one thing to see it: openness, freedom \u2014 the freedom to be open and not tethered by any ideas, concepts, etc. \u2026 When our mind is tranquil, there will be an occasional pause to its feverish activities, there will be a let-go, and it is only then in the interval between two thoughts that a flash of UNDERSTANDING \u2014 understanding, which is not thought \u2014 can take place.",
  "Balance your thoughts with action. \u2014 If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done.",
  "Concepts vs. self-actualization. \u2014 Instead of dedicating your life to actualize a concept of what you should be like, ACTUALIZE YOURSELF. The process of maturing does not mean to become a captive of conceptualization. It is to come to the realization of what lies in our innermost selves.",
  "Life is better lived than conceptualized. \u2014 This writing can be less demanding should I allow myself to indulge in the usual manipulating game of role creation. Fortunately for me, my self-knowledge has transcended that and I've come to understand that life is best to be lived \u2014 not to be conceptualized.
